In this folder I have scripts for comparing my implementation of linear regression with Scikit's.
First prep_data is run to scale features (to boost training) and split the data into test and training set.

To see it in action you can type 
```make test_LR``` from the main folder.

Both implementations are comparable.

Scikit's R^2 on train, test is 0.75, 0.71

Mine R^2 on train, test is 0.75, 0.71
